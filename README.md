# OMDB Movies

## A one-paged searching web application that uses the OMDB API to fetch movies and displays them

This is a small page that displays the available movies using the OMDB API to fetch them.

It uses webpack through `npm` to bundle the contents, that means that no additional installation is required, though it is recommended that `Ritwick`'s `Live Server` is used.

It also uses a `json` file to store the necessary keys to access the API, without it the application won't run.
